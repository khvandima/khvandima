# 👋 Hi, I'm DMITRIY KHVAN  

**AI/ML Engineer | Data Scientist | MLOps**

I work on end-to-end machine learning workflows —  
from data analysis & feature engineering to model training, evaluation,  
and deployment using modern MLOps practices.

I’m also familiar with frontend, backend and iOS development at a practical level,  
but I do not position myself as a specialist in these areas.

## 🔥 What I work with

### 🧠 Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- Scikit-learn
- Feature-engine
- LightGBM / XGBoost  
- TensorFlow / Keras (ANN, CNN, LSTM)  
- EDA & Feature Engineering  
- Model evaluation and optimization  

### ⚙️ MLOps & Deployment

- FastAPI inference API (manual Docker deployment on Railway)  
  → bank-retirement-api

- CI/CD workflows for ML systems (GitHub, CircleCI, Docker, Gemfury, Railway)  
  → bank-retirement-mlops

- Model packaging & reproducible ML pipelines  
  → bank_retirement_classification_model  
  → heart-disease-classification-model (structure reference)

### 🧰 Additional Skills (not my main specialization)
- Basic SwiftUI development (iOS)  
- Basic React & JavaScript  
- Simple backend services in Python  
- REST API fundamentals  

I use these technologies for side projects and practice,  
but my core expertise remains **ML and MLOps**.
