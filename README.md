# 👋 Hi, I'm DMITRIY KHVAN  

**AI/ML Engineer | Data Scientist | MLOps**

I work on end-to-end machine learning workflows —  
from data analysis & feature engineering to model training, evaluation,  
and deployment using modern MLOps practices.

I’m also familiar with frontend, backend and iOS development at a practical level,  
but I do not position myself as a specialist in these areas.

## 🔥 What I work with

### 🧠 Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- Scikit-learn
- Feature-engine
- LightGBM / XGBoost  
- TensorFlow / Keras (ANN, CNN, LSTM)  
- EDA & Feature Engineering  
- Model evaluation and optimization  

### ⚙️ MLOps & Deployment
- FastAPI (model inference APIs)  
- Docker  
- CircleCI (CI/CD workflows)  
- Model packaging & reproducible pipelines  
- Deployment on Railway / Render / AWS  

### 🧰 Additional Skills (not my main specialization)
- Basic SwiftUI development (iOS)  
- Basic React & JavaScript  
- Simple backend services in Python  
- REST API fundamentals  

I use these technologies for side projects and practice,  
but my core expertise remains **ML and MLOps**.
